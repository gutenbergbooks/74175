<p class="ph2"><span class="xlarge">∵</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>HOW POLLY PERKINS WAS MADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly Perkins</span> was a big rag doll, the prettiest,
the softest, the most comfortable rag doll that
ever belonged to a little girl.</p>

<p>Grandmother King made her for Patty, who
was five years old and visiting Grandmother at
the time, and this is just how it all happened.</p>

<p>In the first place, Patty fell downstairs. She
was on her way to the kitchen where Grandmother
was baking a cake, and in her arms she
carried Isabel, the doll she loved the very best
of all. Indeed, Isabel was the only doll that
Patty had brought with her from home. She
was a china dolly, with pretty golden curls and
blue eyes that opened and shut, and she wore a
blue dress with pockets, very much like one of
Patty’s own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Now, as I said, Patty was on her way downstairs
with Isabel in her arms when suddenly
she tripped and fell. Down the whole flight of
stairs she went, bumping on every single step,
it seemed, and landed in a little heap at the foot
of the stairs.</p>

<p>Grandmother heard the sound of the fall, and
came hurrying out of the kitchen with a cup
full of sugar in one hand and a big spoon in the
other.</p>

<p>‘My precious Patty! Are you hurt?’ cried
Grandmother, picking Patty up and rubbing
her back and rocking her to and fro all at the
same time.</p>

<p>When Patty could stop crying, she shook her
head.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said, with a little sniff, ‘I think I
am not hurt. But where is Isabel?’</p>

<p>Oh, poor Isabel! She lay over by the front
door, her head broken into a hundred pieces!</p>

<p>At first Patty couldn’t believe her eyes.
Isabel broken! Then whom would Patty play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
with? Whom would she dress and undress and
take out for a walk every day? Who would lie
beside her on the bed at night while Grandmother
was reading by the lamp downstairs and
Patty felt the need of some one to keep her
company just before she fell asleep?</p>

<p>Isabel broken to pieces!</p>

<p>Then Patty did cry.</p>

<p>‘My dolly! My dolly!’ she wailed. ‘My
dolly is broken! My dolly!’</p>

<p>She struggled out of Grandmother’s arms to
the floor, and there, sobbing and crying as loud
as ever she could, she danced up and down. She
felt so badly she simply couldn’t stand still.</p>

<p>At first Grandmother didn’t say a word.
Very carefully she picked up all that was left of
Isabel. Then she took Patty by the hand.</p>

<p>‘Patty,’ said Grandmother firmly, ‘stop crying
and stand still.’</p>

<p>Patty was so surprised to hear Grandmother
speak in this way that she did stop crying and
stood still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>‘Patty,’ went on Grandmother cheerfully—so
cheerfully that Patty couldn’t help listening
to what Grandmother had to say—‘Patty, we
are going to find a box and put Isabel in it.
Then we will send her home to Mother, who will
buy a new head for her, I know. We will play
that Isabel has been in an accident and that she
has gone down South to be cured. That is what
Mother did last winter when she was so ill, you
remember.’</p>

<p>Patty nodded slowly. Perhaps Isabel could
be cured, after all.</p>

<p>‘But whom will I play with while she is gone?’
asked Patty with a quiver in her voice. ‘I don’t
like Darky. He scratches and spits.’</p>

<p>Darky was a black barn cat who lived next
door to Grandmother, and it is quite true that
he was not a pleasant playmate for a little girl.</p>

<p>‘There is no one for me to play with but you,
Grandmother,’ finished Patty, two plump tears
rolling down her cheeks as she thought how
lonely she would be now without Isabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>For a moment Grandmother stood without
speaking. She was thinking, her foot softly tapping
the floor as Grandmother often did, Patty
knew, when she was making up her mind.</p>

<p>Then Grandmother spoke.</p>

<p>‘Patty, I am going to make you a doll,’ said
Grandmother, ‘an old-fashioned rag doll such as
I used to make for your mother years ago. She
always loved hers dearly, and I expect you will,
too. And the best of such a doll is that it can
never be broken.’</p>

<p>While Grandmother was speaking, Patty’s
face grew brighter and brighter, until, as Grandmother
finished, she really looked her own merry
little self once more.</p>

<p>‘To-day?’ cried Patty hopping up and down,
but this time for joy. ‘Will you make her to-day,
Grandmother? To-day?’</p>

<p>‘This very day,’ answered Grandmother,
picking up her cup of sugar and big spoon from
the corner where she had hastily set them down
when Patty fell. ‘First, I will finish my cake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and then you and I will go out shopping to buy
what we need to make the new doll.’</p>

<p>So a little later Patty and Grandmother,
hand in hand, went down the road and round
the corner to Mr. Johns’ store, where you could
buy almost anything in the world, Patty really
believed.</p>

<p>It was the only store in Four Corners, the
little village where Grandmother lived, and so
of course it kept everything that anybody in
Four Corners might want to buy. On one side
of the store were rows of bright tin pails, and
lawnmowers, and shovels, and rakes, and a case
of sharp knives, and a great saw, too, big enough
to cut down the largest tree that ever grew. On
the other side were dresses and aprons, a hat or
two, gay-colored material and plain white, ribbons
and laces, needles and pins. There were
boxes of soap and boxes of crackers and boxes of
matches. There were shelves filled with cans
and packages of all shapes and sizes. There was
a case full of toys, and a case full of candies, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
where Patty had been known to spend a penny
now and then. There were great barrels standing
about, and rolls of wire netting, and coils of
rope. And on the counter there sat a plump
gray cat, who blinked sleepily at Grandmother
and Patty as they came in and opened his mouth
in a wide yawn.</p>

<p>When Mr. Johns heard what Grandmother
was going to make—for Patty told him just as
soon as Grandmother had inquired for Mrs.
Johns’ rheumatism—he was as interested in the
new dolly as Grandmother or Patty herself.</p>

<p>He measured off the muslin with a snap of his
bright shears. He whisked out a great roll of
cotton batting with a flourish. He helped Patty
decide between pink and blue gingham for a
dress. She chose pink. And last of all it was
Mr. Johns who said,</p>

<p>‘What are you going to put on the dolly for
hair?’</p>

<p>Patty looked at Grandmother and Grandmother
looked at Patty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>‘I hadn’t thought yet about hair,’ began
Grandmother slowly, when Mr. Johns disappeared
beneath the counter.</p>

<p>Patty could hear him pulling and tumbling
boxes about, and at last up came Mr. Johns from
under the counter with his face very red, indeed,
and a smudge of dust on his cheek, but holding
in his hand a little brown curly wig.</p>

<p>‘Will that do?’ asked Mr. Johns, smiling
proudly at his surprised customers. ‘I knew I
had a little wig somewhere, if only I could put
my hand on it. It has been lying around here
for two years or more.’</p>

<p>Two years old or not, the little brown wig was
as good as new, and Patty was so anxious to
have the dolly made and to see how the wig
would look on her head that she pulled at
Grandmother’s hand all the way home and
couldn’t help wishing that Grandmother would
walk faster or perhaps even run, instead of
stopping to chat with her neighbors on the way.</p>

<p>It took a day or two to make the dolly, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Grandmother’s nimble fingers flew. And
one night, after Patty had gone to bed, busy
Uncle Charles drove down from the Farm and
painted the dolly’s face, a pretty face, with rosy
cheeks and gentle dark-brown eyes that Patty
thought the loveliest she had ever seen.</p>

<p>At last the dolly was finished, and in her gay
pink dress, with her soft brown curls that
matched her brown eyes, Grandmother placed
her in Patty’s outstretched arms.</p>

<p>‘I am so happy,’ said Patty, her face aglow,
‘I am so happy that I don’t know what to do.’</p>

<p>So, standing on tiptoe, Patty first kissed
Grandmother and then the dolly and then
Grandmother again. And perhaps, after all,
that was the very best thing that she could do.
Grandmother seemed to think so, at any rate.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t she beautiful?’ said Patty next, holding
the dolly out at arm’s length the better to see
and admire. ‘Her curls are beautiful, and so
are her eyes, and her dress, and her cunning
little brown shoes. What shall I name her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Grandmother? Don’t you think she is beautiful?
Isn’t she the most beautiful dolly that you
have ever seen?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ answered Grandmother, smiling
to see Patty’s pleasure. ‘She is as beautiful
as a butterfly.’</p>

<p>And, to Patty’s further delight, Grandmother
began to sing a little song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘She’s as beautiful as a butterfly,</div>
<div class="indent">And none can compare</div>
<div class="verse">With pretty little Polly Perkins,</div>
<div class="indent">Of Abingdon Square.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>Patty clapped her hands and spun round for
a moment like a top.</p>

<p>‘Sing it again, sing it again,’ she cried.</p>

<p>So Grandmother obligingly sang her little
song again.</p>

<p>And the moment it was ended, Patty, her
cheeks as pink as the dolly’s and her eyes quite
as round and bright, exclaimed,</p>

<p>‘That is my dolly’s name—Polly Perkins!
Pretty Polly Perkins! Don’t you think that is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
good name for her, Grandmother? Don’t you
think Polly Perkins is a good name for my new
dolly to have?’</p>

<p>‘A very good name, indeed,’ was Grandmother’s
reply. ‘She looks like a Polly to me.’</p>

<p>‘She looks like a Polly to me, too,’ agreed
Patty happily, ‘a Polly Perkins.’</p>

<p>And hugging Polly Perkins close, Patty whispered
in her ear.</p>

<p>‘If Isabel is cured,’ whispered Patty to Polly,
‘I shall be glad that I fell downstairs. Because
if I hadn’t fallen, I never would have known you.
Wouldn’t you be sorry, Polly Perkins, if you had
never known me?’</p>

<p>Patty put her ear close to Polly’s red lips to
hear her answer, and she was not disappointed.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ whispered back Polly Perkins, ‘I
would.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>WHERE IS POLLY PERKINS?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Mary</span> had come down from the Farm to
spend the day with Grandmother and with
Patty. She had really come to say good-bye, for
to-morrow Grandmother’s house at Four Corners
would be closed and she and Patty would
start for the city, where Grandmother was to
spend the winter at Patty’s home.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary had brought presents with her
from the Farm, presents that were neatly
packed in boxes ready to be placed in Grandmother’s
big black trunk.</p>

<p>There was a box of home-made sausages, such
as you couldn’t buy in the city no matter how
hard you tried. There was a loaf of Father’s
favorite cake, ‘raised’ cake it was called, covered
over with snowy icing and full of raisins,
as Patty well knew. There were two squash
pies for Mother, packed so carefully that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
couldn’t possibly be broken. Last of all there
was a present for Patty that did not have to be
packed in a box because it was an apron, a
pretty blue pinafore that covered Patty from top
to toe, and that had two pockets large enough
to hold a handkerchief or a ball or anything
else that Patty might choose to put in them.
And on each pocket Aunt Mary had embroidered
a tiny bunch of orange and yellow and
brown flowers.</p>

<p>Patty was delighted with her present.</p>

<p>‘The little flowers look as real as real can be,’
she declared, patting and sniffing the flowers
and patting the pockets again. ‘I think they
smell sweet, Aunt Mary. I truly think they
do.’</p>

<p>Very carefully Patty placed her pinafore in
Grandmother’s trunk, and ran to fetch Polly
Perkins to show her to Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>‘Uncle Charles painted her. Did he tell you?’
asked Patty, dancing Polly up and down before
Aunt Mary until the dolly’s brown curls flew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
‘Isn’t she beautiful, Aunt Mary? Hasn’t she
the prettiest eyes, and doesn’t her mouth look
smiling? I can brush and brush her hair, too,
all I like, and it curls right up again. Isn’t her
dress pretty? How I wish she had pockets like
my new apron! She would be just perfect if she
had pockets on her dress, Aunt Mary.’</p>

<p>‘Run and ask Grandmother for a bit of this
pink gingham,’ said good-natured Aunt Mary,
‘and I will make the pockets for you while we
all sit here and talk.’</p>

<p>Grandmother shook her head and said that
Patty would be spoiled if Aunt Mary were not
careful. But she gave Patty the gingham, and
a moment later Aunt Mary was measuring and
cutting the pockets for Polly Perkins’s dress.</p>

<p>‘Would you like a bunch of flowers or a little
rabbit embroidered on each pocket?’ asked
Aunt Mary, who was so skillful with her needle
that nothing seemed too hard for her to do.</p>

<p>Patty thought for a moment.</p>

<p>‘A rabbit, I think,’ she began slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Then suddenly she spun round on the tips of
her toes.</p>

<p>‘I have thought of something, Aunt Mary!’
cried Patty, smiling a wise little smile. ‘I have
thought of something so nice. Could you sew
Polly’s name on her pockets—Polly on one
pocket and Perkins on the other? Could you do
that, Aunt Mary, do you think?’</p>

<p>Yes, Aunt Mary thought that she could.</p>

<p>‘Here is some green thread in Grandmother’s
basket,’ said she. ‘It will be pretty if I embroider
her name in green on the pink dress,
don’t you think?’</p>

<p>Patty thought it would be beautiful, and said
so. She stood close beside Aunt Mary and
watched her take the first stitches in Polly
Perkins’s name.</p>

<p>Just at that moment who should drive up to
the house but the expressman come for Grandmother’s
trunk hours before he had been expected.
And then such a hurry and bustle to
crowd the last odds and ends into the trunk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to lock it and to strap it, all in the twinkling of
an eye.</p>

<p>But at last it was done, and away went the
trunk, bumping down the porch steps on the expressman’s
back, bumping into the wagon, and
bumping off down the road, round the corner,
and out of sight.</p>

<p>And then, and not until then, it was discovered
that Polly Perkins, pockets and all, had
been left behind. There she lay in Aunt Mary’s
chair where she had been tossed when the expressman
came.</p>

<p>‘Now I can carry her home myself to-morrow,’
said Patty, delighted with this turn of affairs.
‘I can carry her all the way in my arms, can’t I,
Grandmother? Do say that I may!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose that you may,’ answered
Grandmother, who did not look so pleased with
the plan as did Patty. ‘I am afraid there will
not be any room for her in my bag.’</p>

<p>Aunt Mary worked away until the pockets
were finished, and when Patty looked at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
dolly in her gay pink frock, with a green ‘Polly’
on one pocket and a green ‘Perkins’ on the
other, she thought she had never seen anything
so pretty in all her life.</p>

<p>Uncle Charles came to supper and to take
Aunt Mary home, and, before he was inside the
door, Patty was all ready to whisper in his ear
and to give him three kisses, one on each cheek
and one on his chin.</p>

<p>‘I think you paint the loveliest dollies in the
world,’ whispered Patty in Uncle Charles’s ear.
‘And that is why my dolly is named Polly Perkins.
Because she is as beautiful as a butterfly.
Grandmother said so. And I am going to carry
her all the way home in my arms. Grandmother
said that, too.’</p>

<p>But the next morning when Patty woke the
rain was pouring down, and there was no question,
in Grandmother’s mind, at least, about
Patty carrying Polly Perkins in her arms.</p>

<p>‘We will send your dolly home in a box by
express,’ decided Grandmother. ‘You wouldn’t
enjoy carrying her in the rain, I know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>‘She might catch cold,’ agreed Patty, ‘for she
hasn’t any coat. That is the way Isabel went
home, in a box, and I expect she enjoyed it, too.’</p>

<p>So Polly was wrapped in a pink-and-blue
tufted coverlet, that was to have been used as a
traveling-rug, and carefully placed in a large
pasteboard box.</p>

<p>‘Be a good girl,’ whispered Patty, tenderly
kissing Polly good-bye on her rosy mouth.</p>

<p>Then she watched Grandmother wrap the
box in heavy paper and tie it with stout brown
twine.</p>

<p>‘I will have my hands full with a bag and an
umbrella and a child,’ said Grandmother to
Uncle Charles, who had come to take them
down to the train. ‘I can’t think of allowing
Patty to carry her doll. I have packed it in a
box and addressed it to Patty’s mother, and I
want you to leave it at the express office as you
go home, Charles, if it won’t be too far out of
your way.’</p>

<p>Uncle Charles promised to send Polly Perkins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
along that very day. So, with a farewell
pat on the outside of the box that held her dolly,
Patty and Grandmother started on their
journey in the rain.</p>

<p>It was fun traveling in the rain, Patty
thought. She liked to see the people bustling
along in the wet. She liked to watch the dripping
umbrellas bob in and out of the stations
that they passed. She liked the muddy and almost
empty roads, with only now and then a
procession of ducks waddling along, or a lonely
dog trotting by, or a farmer driving into town
with perhaps a colt tied at the back of his cart.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the big city, Patty
peered out of the misty window-pane over which
ran rivulets of raindrops so thick and fast that
the tall houses could scarcely be seen and the
street-lamps looked like cloudy little suns dotting
the way.</p>

<p>‘Are we nearly there?’ asked Patty for at
least the hundredth time.</p>

<p>And at last Grandmother could answer, ‘Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Patty, we are. In five minutes more you will
see Father, I hope.’</p>

<p>Grandmother was right. As the train drew
into the station and men in little red caps, who
wanted to carry your bag, Patty knew, came
running down the platform, there on the platform,
too, stood Father, and a second later
Patty was in his arms.</p>

<p>Through the rain they rode home to Mother,
waiting for them in the large white apartment
house where Patty lived.</p>

<p>There were many houses on the long city
street—tall white apartments, low red-brick
houses, then tall white apartments again.
Patty pressed her nose against the window of
the cab, peering out at the familiar scene.</p>

<p>‘There are our Christmas trees!’ she cried,
catching a glimpse of the two little fir trees that,
in white flower pots, stood one on either side of
the entrance to their apartment house.</p>

<p>‘And there is Thomas in the doorway. He is
watching for me, I do believe.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Thomas was the hall boy, and a good friend
to Patty, too.</p>

<p>‘And there is Mother in the window. Mother!
Mother!’</p>

<p>Patty pounded on the window of the cab
and called and waved. The moment the cab
stopped, without waiting for Father’s umbrella,
across the sidewalk went Patty with a skip and
a jump, up the steps, and into the hall where
she flung both arms about Mother’s neck.</p>

<p>‘I knew you would come down to meet me,’
said Patty, giving Mother the tightest squeeze
she could and smiling broadly at Thomas
over Mother’s shoulder. ‘I have come home,
Thomas. I am home.’</p>

<p>And so she was.</p>

<p>Oh, how much there was to tell and to see!
Patty’s tongue flew, and her bright eyes glanced
hither and thither, and her quick little feet sped
up and down the hall and in and out of the
rooms she remembered so well.</p>

<p>And in her own room who should be waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
for Patty, sitting in the middle of her very own
little bed, but Isabel, home from her trip to the
South and as good as new, only perhaps a little
prettier than before, Patty thought.</p>

<p>‘Now, Isabel,’ said Patty that night in bed,
as Isabel lay where Patty could put out her
hand and touch her if she felt at all lonely before
she fell asleep, ‘now, Isabel, I must tell you
all about your new sister, Polly Perkins. I hope
you are going to be good friends. She will be
home perhaps to-morrow, perhaps the day after,
and I hope you will love her very much indeed.’</p>

<p>Isabel promised that she would. And all the
next day—another rainy day, too—she and
Patty watched for Polly Perkins, though both
Mother and Grandmother said it was far too
soon to expect Polly home. All the next day and
the next and the next Patty and Isabel watched
for Polly, but Polly did not come.</p>

<p>‘Has Polly come?’ was the first question
Patty asked every morning.</p>

<p>And every night when she went to bed she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
said, ‘Please wake me up if Polly comes to-night.’</p>

<p>But Polly did not come.</p>

<p>So Grandmother wrote to Uncle Charles to
ask if he had forgotten to send Polly. And
Uncle Charles wrote back that he had sent her
off the very day that Grandmother and Patty
left Four Corners.</p>

<p>Next Father went to the express office, and
the express office promised to find Polly Perkins,
if it possibly could.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps she has been shipped out West.
Perhaps she is lying in the Four Corners office,’
said the express people. ‘We will find out and
let you know.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Patty watched, and talked, and
wondered what could have become of Polly
Perkins.</p>

<p>‘My darling Polly! She is as beautiful as a
butterfly, Mother,’ said Patty, not once, nor
twice, but many times. ‘You don’t know how
beautiful she is. Grandmother thinks so, too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
That is why I named her Polly Perkins. She
has a pink dress and brown curls and the prettiest
brown eyes. And pockets with her name
on them, Mother. Just think! I can’t wait to
have you see her. I do wish she would come
home.’</p>

<p>But still Polly did not come.</p>

<p>Where is Polly Perkins? What can have happened
to her? Where can she be?</p>

<p>Patty and Mother and Father and Grandmother
all asked these questions over and over
and over. But not one of them guessed the
answer, though they tried again and again.</p>

<p>And now I will tell you what had happened to
Polly Perkins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>POLLY PERKINS GOES ON A JOURNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Patty was watching from the window
all up and down the long city street, hoping that
every passing wagon or automobile would stop
at her door with Polly Perkins, what was Polly
herself doing all this time?</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning, there is no doubt
that Polly was disappointed not to be carried
home in Patty’s arms.</p>

<p>‘I would like to see a little of the world,’
thought Polly, when she heard how she was to
make the journey, ‘and I would like to ride on
the train that Patty talks about. I will be as
good as gold, and then perhaps Patty will always
take me with her when she goes traveling.
Who knows?’</p>

<p>So when Polly saw the rainy day and heard
Grandmother plan to send her home in a box,
Polly couldn’t help being disappointed, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of course she didn’t show it in the least. She
smiled as sweetly as ever when Patty wrapped
her in the pink-and-blue tufted coverlet and
kissed her good-bye. And though she wanted
dreadfully to give the cover of the box just one
gentle kick with her pretty brown slipper, to
work off a little of her disappointment as it
were, still Polly said to herself,</p>

<p>‘No, I won’t kick the box, for I know Patty
wouldn’t like it. And I want to please Patty in
every way I can.’</p>

<p>For Polly had grown to love Patty in the short
time she had lived with her, and she believed
that Patty was the very best mother that ever
a dolly could have.</p>

<p>‘She might leave me out all night in the
grass,’ thought wise little Polly. ‘She might
stick pins into me, or pull my hair, or drop me
down the well. But she never, never does. Oh,
I am glad that Patty is my mother.’</p>

<p>And if, once in a while, Patty gave her a
spanking or put her to bed in the middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
day, why, that was no more than happened to
Patty herself, once in a while, and so of course
Polly could find no fault.</p>

<p>Polly liked Uncle Charles, too. Hadn’t he
given her a pretty face and a sweet smile? So
when Uncle Charles tucked Polly under his
arm to carry her to the express office, Polly gave
one or two gentle bumps on the lid of the box
just to show that she was friendly. But if
Uncle Charles heard them, no doubt he thought
that Polly was simply slipping about, and that
he must carry the box more carefully.</p>

<p>It was not pleasant in the express office,
Polly found. There was a strong smell of tobacco
smoke that sifted straight into Polly’s
box, and there seemed to be men all about, with
loud voices, who tossed packages back and
forth, and hauled heavy boxes from one side of
the room to the other. Polly herself was tossed
up on a shelf where, after a moment or two, she
snuggled down in her coverlet and sensibly fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>She was awakened after a long, long nap by
being lifted off the shelf. She thought it must
be morning, the express office was so busy and
noisy and so many people were hurrying to and
fro.</p>

<p>Then came a great roaring and puffing and
snorting just outside the office door, and Polly
knew in a moment what it was.</p>

<p>‘It is the train,’ thought Polly, who had never
heard one before. ‘That is just the sound Uncle
Charles made when he played train with Patty
the night he came to supper at our house.’</p>

<p>And Polly was right. It was the train.</p>

<p>Now the bustling grew greater than before.
Trunks and heavy boxes were hoisted aboard
the train. Packages, large and small, were flung
on helter-skelter, and among them was Polly,
who went flying through the air and luckily
landed face-up on top of a trunk, where it took
a whole moment to get her breath again. But
Polly didn’t mind being tossed about, not one
bit. She thought it was exciting, and much better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
than lying in the smoky express office on a
shelf.</p>

<p>Then the train whistled and puffed and
panted and was off.</p>

<p>Roar, roar, roar! Clatter, clatter, clatter!</p>

<p>At first Polly couldn’t hear herself think. But
after a short time she grew used to the noise of
the train and could hear the different sounds all
about her in the baggage car in which she lay.</p>

<p>Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! Squawk! Squawk!</p>

<p>‘Hens,’ thought Polly, who had often gone
with Patty to visit the chicken coops at the
back of Grandmother’s yard.</p>

<p>Then she heard a low whining and scuffling
as in answer to the outcry of the hens, and the
next moment a dog lifted his voice in a series of
sharp little barks.</p>

<p>And, would you believe it, Polly understood
every word he said.</p>

<p>‘I am Twinkle. Bow-wow!’ said the little
dog.</p>

<p>And if Polly could only have looked through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her box and seen him, she would have thought
that he couldn’t have a better name. For not
only was there a gay twinkle in his bright black
eye, but the curly tuft of hair on the tip of his
tail seemed to twinkle also as he waved it to and
fro. While his soft black nose was a shining
little spot that might easily have been called a
twinkle, too.</p>

<p>‘Bow-wow!’ said Twinkle again. ‘I belong to
Jimmy, and Jimmy has broken his leg. Wow!
Wow!’</p>

<p>‘Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!’ answered the sympathetic
hens. ‘Too bad! Too bad! Too bad!’</p>

<p>‘I wish I could talk to him,’ said Polly to herself.
‘I am going to try.’</p>

<p>So in her politest voice she called out,
‘Twinkle, I am in this box and my name is
Polly Perkins. I belong to a little girl named
Patty, and I want to talk to you. How did
Jimmy break his leg?’</p>

<p>‘On roller skates. Bow-wow!’ answered
Twinkle, as though it were the most natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
thing in the world to be talking to a dolly
wrapped up in a box.</p>

<p>And, come to think of it, Twinkle didn’t
know that Polly Perkins was a doll. He only
knew that he wanted to tell some one about his
little master Jimmy.</p>

<p>‘He was roller skating in the park,’ called out
Twinkle, ‘and he fell and broke his leg, and if I
had been there it never would have happened.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked Polly. ‘Why wouldn’t it have
happened?’</p>

<p>‘Did he break his leg all last summer while
he was playing with me in the country?’ demanded
Twinkle. ‘Of course he didn’t. But no
sooner does he go back to the city than he falls
and breaks his leg. It all happened because I
wasn’t there to take care of him.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you go to the city with him?’
asked Polly next. You see, Patty wasn’t there
to tell Polly it wasn’t polite to ask quite so many
questions, and Polly was too young to be expected
to know that, all by herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>But Twinkle didn’t mind questions in the
least.</p>

<p>‘Because his mother said the city was no place
for a dog,’ he sniffed scornfully. ‘Just as if I
couldn’t behave as well in the city as anywhere
else. But they have had to send for me now, for
Jimmy wants me. That is where I am going
now on the train.’</p>

<p>‘I am going to Patty’s house,’ volunteered
Polly Perkins. ‘That is where I am going.
Patty couldn’t carry me home yesterday because
of the rain.’</p>

<p>‘Cluck-cluck-cluck-ca-da-cut!’ called the
hens, not wishing to be left out of the conversation.
‘We are going on a pleasure trip, for
pleasure only. We don’t know whether we are
coming back or not. We belong to Farmer
Hill.’</p>

<p>‘I never heard of Farmer Hill,’ barked
Twinkle, ‘but he can’t be as good as Jimmy.
Jimmy is the best little boy that ever lived.’</p>

<p>‘He isn’t any better than Patty,’ spoke up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
loyal Polly. ‘Patty is the best little girl to live
with that any dolly ever knew.’</p>

<p>‘Does she throw sticks in the water for you to
bring out?’ asked Twinkle. ‘Jimmy does.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Polly, ‘but she takes me out
for a walk every day.’</p>

<p>‘Does she run races with you up to the big
tree and back?’ asked Twinkle. ‘Jimmy does.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Polly, ‘but she brushes my
hair and rocks me to sleep and we often have
parties together, Polly and I.’</p>

<p>‘Does she give you chicken bones, always the
drumstick and sometimes more?’ asked Twinkle.
‘Jimmy does.’</p>

<p>But before Polly could answer, and indeed at
the very mention of chicken bones, all the hens
began to squawk and shriek and cluck until the
noise grew so disturbing that a trainhand put
his head in the doorway of the car to see what
was the matter.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Polly and Twinkle
made never a sound. So the trainman only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
shook his cap at the boxful of fluttering hens
and called out, ‘S-sh-sh, Biddy, s-sh-sh!’ Then
he went away.</p>

<p>No sooner was he gone than the hens began
to scold Twinkle, who backed into a corner
as far away from them as his rope would
allow.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you ashamed, you greedy dog, to
talk about eating chicken bones? Squawk!
Squawk!’ chorused the hens. ‘Right to our
faces, too! Squawk! He has no feeling! We will
never speak to him again. Never, as long as we
live! Squawk! Cluck! Cluck!’</p>

<p>Poor Twinkle’s little snub face was all
twisted with worry and fear. Why had he mentioned
chicken bones? How frightened he felt
at these cross hens! He hoped their box was
very strong and would not break.</p>

<p>He longed to talk to Polly about it and to tell
her how he felt, but he didn’t dare speak another
word. Chicken bones so good and sweet!
Chicken bones that he had buried in the garden!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
To think that they should cause him so much
trouble!</p>

<p>The hens were clucking angrily among themselves.
Every now and then one of them would
suddenly poke her head out between the bars
of the box and dart a bitter glance toward
Twinkle.</p>

<p>So Twinkle did the best thing he could think
of at the moment. He put his head down between
his paws and pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p>At the very next station the hens were taken
off the train. They became so excited that they
seemed to forget Twinkle and his chicken bones,
and they did not even send him a parting angry
cluck.</p>

<p>It would not have made any difference if they
had, for Twinkle by that time had really fallen
asleep. This Polly knew because she heard him
give little snores and happy sighs, so Polly, too,
dozed off, which is something travelers often do
on long journeys.</p>

<p>Polly woke to find the train standing still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and to hear Twinkle, who was being led away,
bark again and again,</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Polly, good-bye! Good-bye!’</p>

<p>This must be the city and the end of Polly’s
journeying.</p>

<p>Polly herself, after a long, long wait, was
tossed into an automobile on top of many other
packages, most of them much larger than she,
and presently, amid a great tooting of horns,
they were off.</p>

<p>Polly knew it was raining, raining hard, for
she could hear the steady patter of the raindrops
on the automobile roof and the splash of the
wheels through the puddles in the street.</p>

<p>Up and down, in and out the city streets they
rattled. Over the noisy paving-stones they
rolled with many a bump and jolt. Round the
corners they whirled with a dash.</p>

<p>The ride seemed long to Polly.</p>

<p>‘Where does Patty live? Will I never reach
home?’ wondered Polly.</p>

<p>Faster and faster rolled the automobile,
harder and harder pelted the rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Then Polly felt the packages under her slipping.
Round a corner they went on two wheels,
and out into the street flew Polly in her box to
land in a great puddle with a splash!</p>

<p>On whirled the express wagon out of sight,
and there lay Polly in the street wondering
what in the world would happen to her next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>WHAT ANNE MARIE SAW FROM THE WINDOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne Marie</span> stood in the window looking out
into the rainy street.</p>

<p>Anne Marie was lonely. She had no one with
whom to play. She had no one with whom to
talk.</p>

<p>Over in a corner of the room, her knitting
in her lap, Anne Marie’s grandmother, called
Grand’mère, napped and woke and napped
again. On the mantel-shelf the white marble
clock, upon which rode a bright gilt horse and
horseman who went nowhere, Anne Marie knew,
ticked, ticked, ticked solemnly in the quiet room.</p>

<p>Downstairs in the Bakery, which was owned
by Anne Marie’s father, sat Anne Marie’s
mother in a gay little golden cage from which
she gave change to the customers who filed past
her with packages of rolls or cakes or pastries
or tarts in their arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Anne Marie longed to be downstairs with her
mother, whom she called Maman, and who was
pretty and smiling, with dark curling hair and
bright red cheeks like Anne Marie’s. It was so
cheerful and exciting in the Bakery. Anne
Marie liked the counters piled high with trays
of crisp brown rolls, long loaves of bread, muffins
and buns. She liked the cases filled with
golden and dark and snow-white cakes, with
flaky pastries and tarts. Best of all she liked
to watch the people coming and going, ladies
and gentlemen, little boys and girls.</p>

<p>But that afternoon Maman had shaken her
head when Anne Marie had begged to stay with
her in the Bakery.</p>

<p>‘The shop is not so good a place for a little
girl as is the home,’ Maman had said, kissing
Anne Marie and smoothing back her curls.</p>

<p>Then she had gone downstairs to stay until
dinner-time when the shop would close for the
evening.</p>

<p>Papa Durant had shaken his head, too, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Anne Marie, an arm about his neck, had whispered
that she would like to visit the kitchen
that afternoon.</p>

<p>‘Some other time, my little jou-jou,’ Papa
Durant had whispered back, ‘some day when
we are not so busy. Be a bon enfant and perhaps
you may have a tart, a very little tart, for your
supper to-night.’</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Anne Marie wished
to visit the kitchen. It was a warm, sweet-smelling
place, with great ovens filled with
goodies and white-clad, white-capped, floury
bakers moving steadily about their tasks.</p>

<p>Yes, Papa Durant was justly proud of his
kitchen. He was proud of his Bakery, too. He
was proud of the great gold-and-black sign,
‘<span class="smcap">French Pastry Shop</span>,’ that stretched over the
Bakery door and directly under the window
where Anne Marie now stood.</p>

<p>And Papa Durant was proud of Anne Marie
from the crown of her little black curly head to
the tips of her twinkling dancing toes. He loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the sparkle in her big black eyes, the dimple in
her chin, and her gay little smile.</p>

<p>But this afternoon Anne Marie was not
smiling. Not even the promise of ‘a tart, a very
little tart’ for her supper could make her feel
more cheerful.</p>

<p>For Anne Marie longed for a playmate. She
was tired of all her toys. Grand’mère was good
to Anne Marie, as good as gold. She knitted for
her mittens and stockings without number, and
even now was at work upon a scarf for her, a
scarlet scarf that matched Anne Marie’s cheeks
and would make her look like a Robin Redbreast,
so Papa Durant laughingly said. But
Grand’mère needed so many naps that she
really couldn’t count as a playmate. Even
when she told Anne Marie a story, of princesses
perhaps and of white cats and a fairy prince, at
the most exciting moment Grand’mère would be
sure to remember the evening soup that must
be prepared and would quite forget about Anne
Marie and the fairies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Now, as Anne Marie stood looking out at the
rain, she was thinking, thinking hard.</p>

<p>‘I will think of the naughtiest thing I can do,’
said Anne Marie to herself, ‘and then I will do
it.’</p>

<p>So she thought and thought, and at last she
made up her mind.</p>

<p>‘I will not eat my soup at supper to-night,’
said Anne Marie, smiling at her own naughtiness.
‘I am tired of Grand’mère’s soup. And to-night,
when every one sleeps, I will creep downstairs
to the Bakery and eat the huge cake in the
front window, the white wedding cake with the
tiny bride and groom standing arm in arm on
top. I will eat it every crumb.’</p>

<p>Anne Marie was so pleased with this idea that
there is no telling what fresh piece of mischief
she might have planned if at that moment a
heavy automobile truck had not come swinging
round the corner and dashed up the middle
of the street. And even as Anne Marie stared at
the truck, glad of something new and exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
to see, there bounced, from the back of the
wagon, a box, a large box, that fell with a
splash into a puddle directly under the window
where Anne Marie stood.</p>

<p>Anne Marie waited for the driver of the truck
to run back, pick up his box, and dash off again.
But no, the express wagon swung round the
corner and out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Anne Marie waited for a passer-by to
pick up the box and carry it away. But there
were very few passers-by on this wet day, as
Anne Marie already knew.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to Anne Marie, a
daring thought, that made her cheeks burn and
her very curls bob up and down with excitement.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> will pick up the box,’ thought Anne Marie,
already creeping on tiptoe to the door. ‘That is,
if Grand’mère will say I may go down,’ she
added, with a hand on the rattling white china
doorknob.</p>

<p>‘Grand’mère,’ whispered Anne Marie in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
very smallest possible voice, ‘Grand’mère, may
I go downstairs after the box?’</p>

<p>Grand’mère did not answer. Her head nodded
a little lower, her knitting slipped down in
her lap, and her soft breathing was her only
reply.</p>

<p>‘Grand’mère is sound asleep,’ said Anne
Marie to herself, ‘and I must not wake her. It
would not be kind.’</p>

<p>So softly Anne Marie stole down the stairs,
softly she opened the door to the street. Then
swift as an arrow she darted out into the rain,
picked up the box, and darted back into the
house again.</p>

<p>She was not wet at all. Surely Grand’mère
would not scold. A few raindrops on her hair, a
few splashes on her dress. As for her shoes, she
rubbed them for a moment on the mat, and lo!
they were as dry as dry could be.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘LOOK, GRAND’MÈRE, LOOK!’ CRIED ANNE MARIE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then upstairs crept Anne Marie and into the
kitchen. The paper wrapped about the box was
wet and torn. Anne Marie pulled it off and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>crumpled it up. She stuffed it in the coal scuttle.
Then she opened the box. She lifted out a soft
paper wrapping. She folded back a pink-and-blue
tufted coverlet. And there, smiling up into
her face, lay the prettiest doll that Anne Marie
had ever seen.</p>

<p>Was it Polly Perkins? Why, of course, it was.
And very glad indeed of a breath of fresh air,
too, as you may well imagine.</p>

<p>For a moment in her surprise Anne Marie
could neither speak nor move.</p>

<p>Then into the front room she ran, carrying
the box in her arms, and plumped it down upon
startled Grand’mère’s lap.</p>

<p>‘Look, Grand’mère, look!’ cried Anne Marie,
clasping her hands together in excitement and
delight. ‘A dolly, a bébé, has come to play with
me. Now I shall not be lonely. Now you may
nap all you wish and I shall not care. Look,
Grand’mère, look! A dolly for me!’</p>

<p>Of course Grand’mère looked and lifted out
the dolly and asked questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>And when, at last, Anne Marie had quite finished
telling what had happened, Grand’mère
said solemnly,</p>

<p>‘The Saints have sent it to you, Anne Marie.
Perhaps because you are a good girl. Undoubtedly
the bébé comes from the Saints.’</p>

<p>But neither Papa Durant nor Maman were
quite so sure of this.</p>

<p>‘It fell from a wagon, you say,’ repeated Papa
Durant. ‘What kind of a wagon? A large
wagon? A small wagon?’</p>

<p>‘A large wagon,’ answered Anne Marie, ‘but
not so large as the furniture van that carried
away Madame Provost’s furniture last week.’</p>

<p>‘That tells nothing,’ said Papa Durant, and
forgot all about the dolly in thinking how
to make a new tart of raspberries, nuts, and
whipped cream.</p>

<p>‘Bring me the paper that was wrapped about
the box,’ said Maman.</p>

<p>But when Anne Marie ran to fetch it from the
coal scuttle, the paper was not there. Grand’mère<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
had burned it when she put coal on the
fire to prepare the evening soup.</p>

<p>‘Enjoy the dolly, then,’ said Maman, ‘since
at present we cannot find the owner. Perhaps
some day we shall learn to whom the dolly belongs.
Here is her name, Anne Marie. Polly,
Polly Perkins. It is embroidered on her dress.’</p>

<p>Anne Marie hugged Polly Perkins close.</p>

<p>‘Chérie,’ whispered Anne Marie in Polly’s
ear. ‘Chérie! Dearie!’</p>

<p>She took off all Polly’s clothes, which rested
Polly very much after her long journey, and
put on her a nightdress that had once belonged
to another doll. Next she wrapped her in the
pink-and-blue tufted coverlet and tucked her
up for the night on the seat of a soft comfortable
chair.</p>

<p>Then Anne Marie, herself ready for bed,
knelt beside the chair to say her prayers.</p>

<p>‘The Good God bless Grand’mère and Papa
and Maman and everybody,’ said Anne Marie,
‘and bless Polly Perkins too.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>As for creeping downstairs that night, to eat
the wedding cake with the tiny bride and groom
standing, arm in arm, on top, Anne Marie never
thought of it again. Polly Perkins had made her
forget all about it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>OUT IN THE SNOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a snowy day, and Anne Marie was very
happy.</p>

<p>She was sitting in one corner of the front
room—Grand’mère with her knitting in the
opposite corner—holding Polly Perkins in her
arms and gently singing and rocking her to sleep.</p>

<p>Anne Marie enjoyed a peaceful little time
like this. She liked to hear the hiss of the snow
against the window-pane. She liked the warm,
comfortable feel of Polly in her arms. Above
all she liked to look down into Polly’s smiling
face because it always made Anne Marie feel
like smiling, too.</p>

<p>Now she gave her dolly a tight little hug, and
gently placed a kiss on Polly’s red lips.</p>

<p>‘Are you happy, Dearie?’ whispered Anne
Marie. ‘I am. Oh, how I hope no one ever
comes to take you away from me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>If Polly could only have spoken, without
startling everybody and making them jump,
she would have answered truthfully that she
was happy, too. Anne Marie had loved her
dearly from the very moment that she had first
seen Polly, and Polly with her tender heart had
soon learned in her turn to love Anne Marie.</p>

<p>But do not think for a moment that Polly had
forgotten Patty King. Patty was Polly’s own
mother, as it were. She felt toward Anne Marie
as one might toward an aunt or a kind cousin or
even an older sister or friend. But she still
hoped that some happy day she would find herself
back in Patty’s arms again.</p>

<p>In the meantime she meant to be as pleasant
and as good a dolly as she knew how. So she
smiled sweetly and cuddled close as Anne Marie
sang softly and rocked her to and fro.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Il était un petit navire,</div>
<div class="verse">Il était un petit navire,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui n’avais jam—jam—jamais navigé,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui n’avais jam—jam—jamais navigé,’</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Anne Marie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>‘Now I will tell you what the song is about,
Polly,’ she went on. ‘It is about a little ship
that never, never went sailing on the sea.’</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Anne Marie would
have told Polly more about this little ship, but
just at that moment the front-room door opened
and quite unexpectedly in walked Papa Durant.
Usually at this hour of the morning he was to be
found in the kitchen, giving his orders for the
day and watching his bakers step briskly about
under his keen eye. But here he was, smiling
and rubbing his hands together and even making
a little bow every now and then.</p>

<p>‘Come, Anne Marie,’ said Papa Durant, nodding
at Grand’mère over Anne Marie’s head and
smiling his broadest smile. ‘Together we will
go out into the snow and visit the great toyshop
near by. There you may choose for yourself any
toy that you wish. Any toy, I say. Now run
for your hat and coat. Do not keep me waiting,
Anne Marie.’</p>

<p>Last night Papa Durant had gone to a wedding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Not as one of the guests, oh, no! Far
better than that. Papa Durant had baked the
cakes for the wedding, all the little fancy cakes
that were to be eaten with ice-cream, and also
the great white wedding cake that held the
place of honor in the very center of the table,
with a tiny bride and groom standing arm in
arm on top. Peeping from behind the door,
Papa Durant had actually seen the bride stand
and cut the beautiful wedding cake into generous
slices, and had heard the guests on every side
say that never before had they tasted such
delicious cake.</p>

<p>So this morning Papa Durant felt very happy,
and naturally enough he wanted to make Anne
Marie happy too.</p>

<p>Through the whirling, twirling snowflakes
they trudged hand in hand to the great store
near by, that was really two stores connected
by a little bridge high in the air. And there, in
the busy, bustling toy department, crowded
with Christmas shoppers, for ‘Noel,’ as Anne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Marie called it, was not many days away, and,
surrounded by every kind of a toy that ever was
invented, Anne Marie made her choice.</p>

<p>What did she choose, do you think? A sled!
A gay yellow-and-red sled, with its name
‘Lightning Flash’ painted in bold black letters
on the seat.</p>

<p>Why, out of all these hundreds and hundreds
of toys, did Anne Marie choose a sled? I will
tell you. It was because she saw two little boys
buying a sled exactly like the one she later
chose. And they were so happy and excited and
smiling over their purchase that Anne Marie
felt that a sled was the very finest toy that any
one could have.</p>

<p>So the sled was bought, and Anne Marie rode
home in triumph on it, drawn by Papa Durant,
who then disappeared into the kitchen and left
Anne Marie to play alone.</p>

<p>Not really alone, however, for up in one front
window sat Grand’mère, nodding and smiling
out at Anne Marie, and in the other window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
was perched Polly Perkins, who couldn’t have
looked more interested if she had been a real
little girl. Once, too, Maman actually stepped
out of her golden cage for a moment and waved
her hand and blew a kiss as she watched Anne
Marie run up and down the street.</p>

<p>By-and-by it stopped snowing, and then
Polly Perkins came out for a ride. Snugly
wrapped in the pink-and-blue tufted coverlet
she rode smilingly up and down, lying flat on
the sled, staring up at the sky, and enjoying it
all without any doubt.</p>

<p>Anne Marie enjoyed it too. She grew so bold
that she could run and slide with the sled, run
and slide again. It was great fun.</p>

<p>But presently along came a dog, a brown
shaggy dog, who wore a collar ornamented by a
bell. The dog thought it was fun, too, to run
after the sled. He ran and barked, ran and
barked, and every now and then he would jump
up in the air and whirl around in the snow, he
felt so happy and gay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>He didn’t dream for a moment that Anne
Marie was afraid of him, but she was. She ran
so fast up the street and even round the corner
to get away from the dog that the sled swung
from side to side. It bumped about, it twisted
to and fro.</p>

<p>Finally the dog, with one last joyous bark
and whirl, trotted off to tell his nearest neighbor,
a white, fluffy dog, who only walked out
on a leash, what a pleasant time he had had
playing in the snow.</p>

<p>Then Anne Marie, stopping to catch her
breath, turned about and discovered that Polly
Perkins was gone! The sled was empty, and
along the whole length of the long city block
Polly was not to be seen.</p>

<p>This was too dreadful! Anne Marie pressed
her red-mittened hands together hard. What
should she do? She wanted to sit down on the
sled and cry, but she knew that was not the way
to find Polly Perkins.</p>

<p>To and fro ran Anne Marie in the snow, hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
for Polly Perkins. Up and down the street
she went again and again, looking from side to
side. But her search was in vain. Polly was not
lying in the snow. She had not been tossed out
into the street. There was not a trace left of
Polly Perkins. There was not a glimpse to be
seen of her pretty pink dress nor of the tufted
pink-and-blue coverlet in which she had been so
warmly wrapped. Anne Marie could scarcely
believe it, but it was true. Polly was gone.</p>

<p>Anne Marie went home in tears. They rolled
so fast down her cheeks that the gay red mittens
could not wipe them away. And once home she
could hardly tell what had happened, she was so
choked with sobs.</p>

<p>Every one was sorry for Anne Marie. Papa
Durant left his baking, though there were pastries
in the oven, and went out to look for Polly
Perkins in the snow. Maman drew Anne Marie
into the golden cage, and, smoothing back her
curls, not only whispered that Noel was near
and that the little Noel might possibly place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
another bébé in Anne Marie’s shoe, but she also
slipped a rich yellow sponge cake into the little
girl’s hand.</p>

<p>‘Do not weep, Anne Marie. The Saints will
bring back your bébé,’ declared Grand’mère, so
distressed at Anne Marie’s sorrow that she
dropped three stitches in her knitting, a thing
she had never been known to do before.</p>

<p>Then Grand’mère laid aside her knitting
and took Anne Marie upon her lap, and told
her the fairy story of the White Cat, without
once stopping to go and prepare the evening
soup.</p>

<p>But even all this kindness could not console
Anne Marie for the loss of Polly Perkins.</p>

<p>Sadly the bright new red-and-yellow sled was
left standing in the lower hall behind the door
to the street. Anne Marie could play no more
that day. Her heart was too heavy.</p>

<p>When at last bedtime came and Anne Marie
in her nightgown knelt at Grand’mère’s knee,
her prayer was very short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>‘May the Good God and all the Saints remember
how lonely I am and please send Polly
Perkins home to me again,’ prayed little Anne
Marie.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>WEE AILIE McNABB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wee Ailie McNabb</span> was going shopping, and
shopping all alone. She held five cents tight in
her little red hand, as she tucked the old plaid
shawl snugly along Granny’s back and softly
patted Granny’s shoulder by way of saying
good-bye.</p>

<p>Granny and Ailie lived together in one small
room at the very tiptop of a tall, tall building.
Indeed, the building was so high that, looking
from the window, Ailie felt very near the clouds
in the sky and the birds that sometimes flew
past. While at night it almost seemed as if, by
putting out her hand, she might draw the glittering
moon and stars down into the room that
Ailie called home.</p>

<p>But there had been little time lately for looking
out of the window. Granny was ill, with a
troublesome cough, and Ailie had been obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to take care of Granny, and run all the errands,
and even now and then to cook the ‘porritch,’
which was often all she and Granny ate nowadays
for breakfast, dinner, and supper.</p>

<p>Now Ailie, still clutching her precious five
cents, took a small tin pail from the table, and
with a last gentle pat on Granny’s shoulder tip-toed
from the room.</p>

<p>Down the four long flights of stairs she
climbed, and, opening the door to the street,
stepped out into the cold.</p>

<p>The wind whistled and sang a wintry tune,
and Ailie gave a little shiver as her short skirt
flapped about her knees. Ailie’s coat was thin.
There was a hole in the side of her shoe. But
she wore a warm tam-o’-shanter hat that pulled
down nicely over her ears, and though she owned
no mittens, of course she could always draw her
hands up inside her coat-sleeves.</p>

<p>Ailie was going for a bit of milk. Not only
did it taste ‘rare fine’ poured over the ‘porritch,’
as Ailie was often heard to say, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Granny could sometimes take a sip of milk
when she could touch nothing else.</p>

<p>Swinging her pail, Ailie skipped along the
snowy street to the grocery store. Closely she
watched the pouring of the milk from the tall
can into her little pail, for Ailie was a good
shopper. Granny herself said it, so of course it
must be true.</p>

<p>Then, making sure that the cover of her pail
was on firm and tight, Ailie started for home.</p>

<p>She was walking slowly, carefully balancing
her pail, for she did not mean to spill one single
drop of milk, when, only a step or two from her
own doorway, she saw lying before her on the
sidewalk a beautiful big rag doll.</p>

<p>Ailie set her pail down in the snow and picked
up the dolly. Then she turned and looked up
and down the long city street.</p>

<p>At one end of the block was a boy shoveling
snow. Clearly he had not lost a doll. Two men
were walking toward Ailie. Their coat-collars
were turned up about their ears, their hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
were thrust deep into their overcoat pockets,
and they were talking so busily as they passed
that they did not even give Ailie a glance.</p>

<p>If Ailie had gone down to the corner and
there looked up the street, she would have seen
a little girl—Anne Marie, of course—running
wildly along, a friendly little brown dog leaping
and whirling at her side. And if Ailie, a few
moments later, had peered from her window,
though, to be sure, it was so high that it was
hard to see the street, she might have spied
Anne Marie searching, with tears in her eyes, for
her lost Polly Perkins. If she had done those
things, it is very likely that Anne Marie would
not have gone crying to bed that night.</p>

<p>But Ailie did not think of going down to the
corner. Neither did she look from the window
when she had hastily climbed the four flights of
stairs, with the pail of milk in one hand and the
beautiful dolly tenderly clasped in the other arm.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="062_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/062_facing.jpg" alt="HOW AILIE ADMIRED POLLY’S PRETTY PINK DRESS">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">OH! HOW AILIE ADMIRED POLLY’S PRETTY PINK DRESS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>‘Eh, my good little Ailie,’ whispered Granny,
opening her eyes and trying to smile as Ailie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>held Polly Perkins up before her and told how
she had found her lying in the snow, ‘sit ye
doun and rock your bairn the while I sleep
again to ease the cough.’</p>

<p>So down before the stove sat Ailie with Polly
in her lap. First of all she unfastened the pink-and-blue
coverlet that had been pinned about
Polly’s shoulders as a shawl. And then, oh! how
Ailie admired Polly’s pretty pink dress with the
pockets, and her neat brown slippers, and her
soft glossy curls.</p>

<p>‘Once I had a blue dress like yours,’ murmured
Ailie to Polly, as she settled her in her
lap and gave her a little hug, ‘but it was a long
while ago before Granny and I were alone. It
may have been that my mither made it for me,
but I cannot just remember how it was.’</p>

<p>Of course Polly didn’t answer. But there was
a look in her brown eyes that did almost as well
as if she had spoken, and Ailie did not ask for
anything more.</p>

<p>‘My Aunt Elspeth is coming soon,’ went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Ailie in such a low voice that it did not disturb
Granny in the least. ‘My Aunt Elspeth is coming
to take care of Granny and me. She is coming
in a big ship from Scotland. She wrote
Granny a letter to tell her so. And when
she comes she will cure Granny’s cough and
make a new dress for me, maybe, just like
yours.’</p>

<p>It was such a comfort to talk, and to talk to
some one who really seemed to care as Polly did,
that Ailie couldn’t and didn’t think of stopping.</p>

<p>‘This is what I would like best of all,’ she
went on, her sandy curls standing out all round
her head and her honest Scotch blue eyes growing
bright as she talked. ‘It is a secret, but I
will tell it to you. I would like a mither, a pretty
mither all my own, and she would wear a real
silk dress every day. And I would like a father
who would put his hand in his pocket and pull
me out a penny just as if it were nothing at all.
And I would like four little brothers and four
little sisters to play with me, and we would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
happy all day long. Aye, I would like that fine,
wouldn’t you?’</p>

<p>It really seemed as if Polly Perkins answered
‘yes.’ At any rate, Ailie was so delighted with
the dolly that she fell asleep at night with a
smile on her face, a smile that cheered Granny
greatly and almost made her feel better as she
turned and tossed and coughed the long night
through.</p>

<p>But in the morning Granny was not so well,
and Mrs. McFarland, who lived downstairs,
put a shawl over her head and stepped out for
the doctor.</p>

<p>‘You need good food and rest, Mrs. McNabb,
and take this medicine that will cure your cough
in a wink,’ said the cheerful doctor.</p>

<p>So Ailie, with Polly in her arms, ran for the
medicine.</p>

<p>She told the friendly druggist all about
Granny and about Polly, too. Then she started
for home.</p>

<p>She hurried along, holding Polly close, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
she hurried a little girl, in a bright red scarf and
red mittens, with a sled at her heels, suddenly
stood before her and caught Polly almost out of
her arms.</p>

<p>‘It is my doll! It is my doll!’ the little girl
was saying over and over again.</p>

<p>When Ailie heard those words, and knew that
the little girl meant to take Polly away from
her, if she could, would you believe it, Ailie
didn’t care at all whether the dolly had once
belonged to this strange little girl or not. She
only knew that she wanted with all her heart to
keep the dolly for her own, and that she simply
could not bear it if she had to give her up.</p>

<p>So she held tight to Polly Perkins, as tight as
ever she knew how, and the strange little girl
pulled and tugged with all her might and main.
And while they were struggling, with their
faces very red and their lips shut very tight,
along the street came two ladies and another
little girl.</p>

<p>They stopped, at least the little girl did, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
in a moment the little girl began to jump up
and down, her brown hair flying, and to call out
in a shrill little voice,</p>

<p>‘It is Polly! It is my Polly Perkins! Mother!
Grandmother! It is my Polly Perkins!’</p>

<p>And then the third little girl caught hold of
Polly and began to pull too.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THREE LITTLE GIRLS AND POLLY PERKINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no telling how this tug of war might
have ended, three little girls pulling away at
poor Polly Perkins, if Ailie had not dropped
Granny’s bottle of medicine in the snow.</p>

<p>‘Och me!’ cried Ailie, and let go of Polly at
once. Granny must have her medicine, even
though it meant that Ailie would never hold
Polly in her arms again.</p>

<p>Fortunately the bottle was not broken. And
by the time Ailie had picked it up, one of the
ladies, the taller one, who later proved to be
Grandmother King, had stepped forward and
taken Polly Perkins out of the hands of Anne
Marie and of her little granddaughter, Patty
King.</p>

<p>‘Let me see the doll, children,’ said Grandmother
quietly. ‘I can tell in a moment, Patty,
whether it is your Polly Perkins or not, for I
made her, you know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Of course it was Patty’s Polly Perkins. It
took only a glance to tell Grandmother so. But
once that point was settled, Grandmother looked
at the three little girls standing before her and
scarcely knew what to do or say next.</p>

<p>For each little girl wanted Polly Perkins, oh!
so badly. You could tell it only to look at them,
though no one said a word.</p>

<p>Patty’s arms were stretched out toward
Polly, and there was a look of surprise on her face
as if she couldn’t understand why Grandmother
didn’t give her the dolly that had been made
expressly for her.</p>

<p>Anne Marie had clasped her red-mittened
hands tightly together, her eyes were big and
round, and she looked as if in one moment more
she would sit right down on the sidewalk and
begin to cry.</p>

<p>While Ailie, clutching her bottle of medicine
close, pressed her lips together in a thin little
line and winked her blue eyes as fast as ever she
could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>‘Not that I’m thinking of crying,’ said Ailie
McNabb to herself.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ spoke Grandmother at last, with a
smile straight into the eyes of each little girl,
‘well, I have often heard of one mother with
three children, but I never before knew of three
mothers and only one child.’</p>

<p>At this Patty and Anne Marie each mustered
up a faint smile, but not Ailie. This was no
time for smiling, thought she.</p>

<p>‘Now I know one of you mothers well,’ went
on Grandmother in her pleasant voice. ‘It is
my own little granddaughter Patty, for whom I
made this dolly when she was paying me a
visit not long ago. But won’t you two little
girls tell me who you are and how you both
happen to think that Polly Perkins belongs to
you?’</p>

<p>Anne Marie was glad of a chance to speak.</p>

<p>‘I am Anne Marie Durant,’ said she, making
a polite little curtsy to Grandmother as Maman
had taught her to do, ‘and my papa owns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Bakery down there on the corner. “<span class="smcap">French
Pastry Shop</span>” the sign says over the door. And
one rainy day I was looking from the window.
We live just over the shop, you know, Papa and
Maman and Grand’mère and I. And I saw a
box fall from a wagon. No one came for the
box, there it lay in the rain, so I ran down and
picked it up, and in the box was Polly Perkins.
We could not find to whom the box belonged.
Grand’mère had burned the paper wrapped
about it. And so I kept Polly Perkins. Grand’mère
said, too, the Saints had sent her to me.
And yesterday I lost her, lost her from this sled.
And that is all,’ said Anne Marie, quite out of
breath, finishing off her long speech with another
little curtsy and a smile.</p>

<p>‘I know your Bakery well, Anne Marie,’ said
Patty’s mother. ‘I go there almost every day,
I think.’</p>

<p>It was now Ailie’s turn to speak, and speak
she did, but her voice was so low that she could
scarcely be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Grandmother managed to understand her,
however, and when Ailie had finished her story,
Grandmother drew her close to her side and
patted her softly upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Of course I understand just how it was,’ said
Grandmother kindly. ‘Anne Marie lost Polly
yesterday in the snow and Ailie picked her up.
In a way Polly Perkins does belong to each one
of you three little girls. Now let me think for a
moment.’</p>

<p>Grandmother stood quite still, with her foot
tapping the sidewalk in a way that Patty knew
very well. Without a doubt Grandmother was
making up her mind about something.</p>

<p>Then Grandmother took Mother by the arm
and walked up the street with her, talking busily
all the while.</p>

<p>Patty and Anne Marie and Ailie stared at one
another, already looking much happier, all
three, and even smiling a little now and then.
For somehow they all felt that Grandmother
was going to make everything come out right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
though how she would do it they didn’t even try
to guess.</p>

<p>Grandmother still held Polly Perkins in her
arms, and over Grandmother’s shoulder Polly
smiled sweetly down in a way that was pleasant
to see. Patty couldn’t help thinking that Polly’s
brown eyes held a special look for her. But then
who knows that Anne Marie and Ailie were not
thinking the very same thing?</p>

<p>At last back came Mother and Grandmother
to where the little girls stood.</p>

<p>‘Remember,’ Mother was saying with a
shake of the head, ‘that Christmas is only one
week away.’</p>

<p>‘I know it,’ answered Grandmother, who no
longer tapped her foot, ‘but I have done much
harder things than this. Besides, you will help
me, I am sure.’</p>

<p>What did Grandmother mean? The children
couldn’t imagine, nor did they have time to
try.</p>

<p>For Grandmother had made up her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
what she meant to do, and at once she started
Mother and Patty and Anne Marie off for the
Bakery, and Grandmother and Polly Perkins
and Ailie set out for Ailie’s house.</p>

<p>Now this is a strange thing, but one quite apt
to happen in a large city. It turned out that
Patty and Anne Marie and Ailie lived almost
within a stone’s throw of one another.</p>

<p>It was this way. On the corner of two streets
lived Anne Marie, upstairs over her Bakery, as
you know. On one of these two streets, in her
large white apartment house, lived Patty. On
the other of these streets, at the tiptop of her
tall, tall building, lived wee Ailie McNabb.</p>

<p>Well, Mother and Patty and Anne Marie
went straight to the Bakery, and there it was
discovered that Maman knew Mrs. King very
well. Had not Mrs. King for years bought her
rolls and bread, her cakes and tarts, at the
‘<span class="smcap">French Pastry Shop</span>’? Out of the golden
cage stepped Maman. Papa Durant was sent
for and hastily came up from the kitchen, bowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and smiling and rubbing his hands as he
always did when very well pleased.</p>

<p>The story of Polly Perkins was told from the
very beginning, and then Mother delivered
Grandmother’s invitation, that came as a great
surprise to the little girls who heard it.</p>

<p>‘Might Anne Marie come to spend the afternoon
with Patty on Christmas Eve? The hour,
four o’clock.’</p>

<p>Anne Marie and Patty squeezed one another’s
hands in rapture at the thought.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, certainly,’ answered Maman and
Papa Durant. ‘We shall be only too delighted
to accept for Anne Marie.’</p>

<p>Down at the end of the street, Grandmother,
holding Ailie’s little red hand, slowly climbed
the four long flights of stairs that led to Ailie’s
home.</p>

<p>Into the poor little room stepped Grandmother,
at once setting startled Granny McNabb
at ease by her smile and pleasant manner,
even before she had time to explain what errand
had brought her there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>‘Take a spoonful of this medicine before we
say a word, Mrs. McNabb,’ said Grandmother,
placing a chair close by Granny’s side, ‘for
Ailie tells me it will cure your cough as quick as
a wink.’</p>

<p>By the time Grandmother had finished her
talk and was ready to go, she and Granny
McNabb had become good friends.</p>

<p>‘You must let me look after you a bit until
Aunt Elspeth’s ship comes in,’ said Grandmother,
as she was leaving. ‘We live only
around the corner and are neighbors, you know.
At least we would be neighbors if we were out in
the country, where I live most of the year. I
shall bring around to-day the broth I told you
of, that helped me when I had a cough like
yours. And I am sure that my little granddaughter
Patty has a number of outgrown
clothes that will fit your good wee Ailie here.</p>

<p>‘Don’t forget the party, Ailie, on Christmas
Eve, at four o’clock.’</p>

<p>And Grandmother, still carrying Polly Perkins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
went carefully down the stairs, leaving
Ailie to rush back into the room to tell Granny
over and over again just how it had all happened.</p>

<p>‘She is a grand good friend,’ said Granny
with a nod of her head. ‘You can read it in her
face.’</p>

<p>‘Aye, that you can,’ answered wee Ailie.</p>

<small>GRANDMOTHER KING’S CHRISTMAS PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Patty</span> was so surprised at everything that had
happened that she didn’t know what to think.</p>

<p>You may imagine how surprised she felt to
see her own dear lost Polly Perkins being almost
pulled apart in the street by two strange little
girls. But you may also imagine her surprise to
find on reaching home that Grandmother had
carried Polly into her own room and that Patty
was not to see her at all.</p>

<p>‘It is Christmas time, Patty,’ said Mother
with a smile. ‘Remember Grandmother’s
Christmas Party and be patient and wait.’</p>

<p>That was all Mother would say to Patty
about it, and Grandmother told her even less.
Indeed, Grandmother now spent most of her
time shut in her own room, while Mother went
about with a smile on her face, closing closet
doors that would pop open and whisking parcels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
into bureau drawers so that Patty might not
see.</p>

<p>In a day or so Patty began to smell a Christmas
Tree, but though she searched and searched
she could find no trace of one.</p>

<p>‘But I know I smell a Christmas Tree, Isabel,’
confided Patty to her doll. ‘Don’t you?
And don’t you want to see Polly Perkins the
worst way now that she is in the house with us?
I don’t see how I can ever wait for Grandmother’s
Party, Isabel. Oh, how I wish Christmas
Eve was this very, very minute.’</p>

<p>But there was so much Christmasing going
on in Patty’s house, these days, that really the
time passed quickly, after all.</p>

<p>One night Father went into Grandmother’s
room straight from dinner, and though the door
was shut tight and even locked, Patty could hear
Father laugh, great big laughs over something
so funny that it made Patty smile, too, though
she couldn’t guess what the joke was about.
She even lay on the floor and tried to peep under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Grandmother’s door, but she couldn’t see a
thing, not even feet. When Father came out,
his fingers were stained the strangest colors, and
there was a great streak of red on his cheek.
But still Patty couldn’t imagine what he had
been doing.</p>

<p>One day Mother went out shopping, and came
home with her arms full of queer knobby bundles.
Another day Grandmother went, and
brought home any number of packages, large
and small, that were whisked out of sight before
Patty could take so much as a peep. And every
night, when Father came home, Patty was shut
in the dining-room until Father’s pockets were
emptied and their contents hidden away.</p>

<p>But at last the day of Grandmother’s Party
came, Christmas Eve, bright and frosty and
clear.</p>

<p>Patty and Isabel spent the morning alone in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>‘I promised Mother we wouldn’t peek, Isabel,’
said Patty, ‘and neither will we listen.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>So over her head Patty tied a scarf, while
Isabel had a little shawl pinned under her chin
that shut out every sound that could possibly
drift into the room.</p>

<p>‘We look like beggars,’ said Patty, ‘but I
don’t care. You are such a good child, Isabel,
that you shall come to the party, too, just as if
you were a real little girl.’</p>

<p>And so Isabel did. For when four o’clock
came, time for the party to begin, there sat
Isabel on the dining-room table dressed in her
best, which of course was her one blue dress, but
with clean face and hands and shining hair,
waiting for the guests to arrive.</p>

<p>By this time Patty couldn’t sit still a minute.
She fluttered up and down the hall and in and
out of the dining-room. She straightened Isabel’s
dress and smoothed her curls over and over
again. A half-dozen times she thought she heard
the doorbell ring. A half-dozen times she opened
the door only to find no one there.</p>

<p>But at last the bell did ring. It was Anne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Marie, her black eyes big and bright and her
cheeks as red as the little scarlet frock she wore.
Papa Durant had brought her, and had left in
her arms a huge box which Anne Marie put into
Grandmother’s hands with her very best curtsy
and smile.</p>

<p>‘For the Party, for Noel,’ said Anne Marie.</p>

<p>It was a box of cakes, French Christmas
cakes, covered with sugar frosting, pink and
green and white, and on many of them appeared
the words ‘Joyeux Noel,’ which was
Anne Marie’s French way of saying ‘Merry
Christmas.’</p>

<p>Then in came wee Ailie McNabb, warmly
dressed not only in a blue coat that Patty had
outgrown, but also in a neat little frock that had
once belonged to Patty, it is true, but that
fitted wee Ailie McNabb as if it had been made
for her.</p>

<p>Straight up to Grandmother walked Ailie and
stretched out a small foot clad in a glossy brown
shoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>‘They are fine and warm,’ said Ailie, just as if
Grandmother knew all about them, as no doubt
she did.</p>

<p>It was time then for the front-room door to be
opened. And fortunately Father now came home
from the office, for Patty felt that not even a
Christmas Party would be quite perfect unless
Father were there to enjoy it too.</p>

<p>So the front-room door was thrown open and
in they went, first Anne Marie and Ailie and
Patty, carrying Isabel, and then Grandmother
and Mother and Father close behind.</p>

<p>The first thing they saw, that filled all one
side of the room, was—well, can’t you guess?
A Christmas Tree! A great, shining Christmas
Tree that touched the ceiling of the room
and spread out its branches far and wide on
either hand. A great, shining Christmas Tree,
covered with glittering balls and bells and
chains, with beautiful stars and candles of every
hue.</p>

<p>But, would you believe it, though it was by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
far the gayest, prettiest sight that Patty or
Anne Marie or Ailie had ever looked upon,
after the first glance the three little girls did not
look at the Tree at all.</p>

<p>They were looking at something under the
Tree, at something so delightful, so exactly
what they wanted to see, that they simply
could not look at anything else.</p>

<p>For each little girl was looking at Polly
Perkins sitting under the Tree. But instead of
<i>one</i> Polly Perkins there were <i>three</i>!</p>

<p>Yes, actually three Polly Perkinses, looking
exactly alike, with gentle brown eyes and pretty
pink cheeks and glossy brown curls. And each
Polly Perkins wore a sweet, sweet smile. There
were the three pink dresses, the three pair of
neat brown slippers, too.</p>

<p>It was simply too good to be true. But it was
true. Oh, yes, indeed, it was.</p>

<p>Down on the floor before one Polly Perkins
went Patty King, down went Anne Marie
Durant before another, and last of all down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
went Ailie McNabb before the third Polly
Perkins sitting under the Tree.</p>

<p>Then Grandmother stepped forward and
placed a dolly in each of the little girls’ arms.</p>

<p>‘This is your dolly, Anne Marie,’ said Grandmother,
her face as bright as that of the little
girls. ‘Her name is on her apron—Polly Perkins
Durant. And here is your doll, Ailie, with
Polly Perkins McNabb embroidered on her
apron, too. And here, my Patty, is your own
dolly back again, with Polly Perkins King on
her apron for every one to see.’</p>

<p>Sure enough, each dolly wore a pinafore, a
fine white pinafore, too, and across the hem, in
the neatest stitches ever seen, ran each dolly’s
name, just as Grandmother said.</p>

<p>And over each dolly’s arm was flung a cape,
a cape with a hood, and as soon as they were
tried on, it was seen that they were the most
beautiful capes that had ever been made.</p>

<p>Patty’s Polly wore a brown cape and hood,
edged with beaver fur, and lined with a lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
rose-colored silk. Anne Marie’s Polly wore a
gray cape and hood, trimmed with soft black
fur, and lined with a pale shade of blue, while
Ailie McNabb’s Polly wore a dark blue cape and
hood, edged with squirrel fur, and lined with the
gayest Scotch plaid silk that Grandmother
could find in all the city of New York.</p>

<p>At first the little girls couldn’t speak a word.
They could only look and look, each one at her
own Polly Perkins.</p>

<p>Then Patty turned and said, ‘Oh, Grandmother!’
and flung both arms about Grandmother’s
neck and gave her a mighty hug.
Next, to every one’s surprise, shy little Ailie did
the same. And last of all Anne Marie stepped
up and not only gave Grandmother a polite
little hug, but dropped her a curtsy and placed
a kiss on her hand as well.</p>

<p>‘Merci, Madame, merci,’ said Anne Marie, so
excited that, for the moment, she quite forgot
how to speak English.</p>

<p>‘Isabel,’ then cried Patty, turning to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
table where Isabel had been hastily set down,
‘Isabel, look at Polly Perkins, do! Isn’t she a
sister that you are proud to have? Oh, how
glad I am that Polly is home with us at last!’</p>

<p>Ailie slipped a little hand into Grandmother’s
and smiled up into her new friend’s face.</p>

<p>‘’Tis rare fine,’ whispered Ailie, pointing to
the gay Scotch plaid lining in her dolly’s cape,
‘and Granny will be saying so, too, I’m thinking.
The prettiest one of all.’</p>

<p>Holding their dollies the little girls could now
turn their attention to the Tree.</p>

<p>It really seemed as if all the bright, sparkling,
glittering objects in the world had been brought
together and hung upon this Tree for Grandmother
King’s Christmas Party.</p>

<p>Chains and balls, flowers and fruit, icicles and
snowballs, all in gold and silver, rose and blue,
scarlet and green, swung and bloomed on the
thick, sweet, green boughs. There were gay
cornucopias filled to the brim. There were
chocolate roosters and chickens and ducks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
There were pink-and-white peppermint baskets
and canes and hats. There were fairy ships, and
a parrot in a cage, and wee birds in a nest, and
two little babies asleep in a cradle, side by side.
And over all, on the topmost bough, there shone
a great silver star, that seemed to glow with as
pure and clear and frosty a light as that of any
real star in the sky on this Eve of Christmas
Day.</p>

<p>Then came ice-cream—for Grandmother
said it wouldn’t be a real party without ice-cream—and
Anne Marie’s Christmas cakes,
oh, so good! And candy, as much as you could
eat. And last of all, you might choose whatever
you would, to keep, from off the Christmas
Tree.</p>

<p>Patty chose the two little babies asleep in the
cradle, Anne Marie chose a silver-and-white
fairy dancer, and Ailie’s choice was the bright
little red-and-green parrot swinging in his cage.</p>

<p>‘He will keep Granny company when I go
out to shop,’ explained Ailie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Papa Durant came to take Anne Marie home,
and bowed and smiled and rubbed his hands together
when he heard the praises of his Christmas
cakes, and saw Polly Perkins Durant held
in happy Anne Marie’s arms.</p>

<p>Thomas, the hall boy, who had brought wee
Ailie McNabb to the party, was to take her
home again.</p>

<p>But just at the last moment, Patty asked a
question that made every one at the Party
stand still and think.</p>

<p>‘What will Santa Claus say to-night when
he sees <i>three</i> Polly Perkinses?’ asked Patty.</p>

<p>And that was a question no one could answer,
not even Grandmother King.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>ANNE MARIE AND THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> did Santa Claus say when he saw the
three Polly Perkinses?</p>

<p>That is something you and I will never know,
unless some day one of the Polly Perkinses opens
her lips and tells.</p>

<p>For, of course, no one saw Santa Claus that
Christmas Eve. Neither Patty, nor Ailie, nor
Anne Marie, nor any one of the hundreds and
hundreds of little boys and girls who meant to
lie awake that night and steal a glimpse of
Santa Claus, or at least hear the patter of his
reindeer’s hoofs or catch the faintest tinkle of
their bells.</p>

<p>But Anne Marie did see the Christmas Angel.</p>

<p>To be sure, there was one moment the next
day when she thought it might have been all
a dream. But that moment was very short,
indeed. And finally Anne Marie made up her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
mind that not only had she seen the Christmas
Angel, but that the Angel had bent over her bed
and had smilingly given her a gentle Christmas
kiss.</p>

<p>When Anne Marie, holding fast to Papa
Durant’s hand, walked home from the Party,
although the walk was a short one, she managed
to tell him everything that had happened, from
the moment she had presented her Christmas
cakes to Grandmother King until Papa Durant
himself had come to take her home.</p>

<p>She scarcely glanced up at the deep-blue
starry sky. She scarcely noticed the happy
people, laden with bundles, who hurried to and
fro in the gay and frosty street.</p>

<p>Once home, she could scarcely eat her supper,
so eager was she to tell Grand’mère all about the
Christmas Party and to display the new Polly
Perkins Durant in all her beauty of fresh pink
frock and gray cloak and hood.</p>

<p>‘This cape is worthy of Paris,’ pronounced
Grand’mère, after carefully examining not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the cape, but the pale blue lining as well. And
this, from Grand’mère was praise indeed, as
Anne Marie well knew.</p>

<p>It seemed very hard that Anne Marie could
not tell Maman all about her happy afternoon,
nor even show to her Polly Perkins Durant.</p>

<p>But Christmas Eve was a busy night in the
Bakery, and Maman would sit late in her little
golden cage, not leaving it until Anne Marie had
long been abed and asleep. Of course, their
friends and patrons must have their Christmas
cakes and pastries, their Christmas buns and
rolls. Anne Marie would not have had it otherwise.</p>

<p>‘But I would like to slip downstairs just for
a moment to show my Polly to Maman,’ coaxed
Anne Marie, leaning across her bowl of bread
and milk to pat Grand’mère upon the cheek.</p>

<p>Although Grand’mère smiled at Anne Marie,
she shook her head.</p>

<p>‘That would not please Maman,’ was Grand’mère’s
answer, and Anne Marie knew it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
true. ‘You may show her your Polly to-morrow
morning when you wish her “Joyeux Noel.”
Maman left a message for you, Anne Marie.
She said that you might go into her bedroom
and look at her ball dress that is lying on the
bed, but that you must not touch it. Wait,
Anne Marie, wait for me.’</p>

<p>For already Anne Marie had slipped from her
chair, and with Polly in her arms was hurrying
down the hall toward Maman’s bedroom.</p>

<p>‘You did not know it, Polly,’ said Anne
Marie as she went, ‘but to-night Papa and
Maman go to the ball. And of all the lovely
ladies who will be there to-night, in pink and
blue dresses, in scarlet and white, Maman will
be the loveliest of them all. Papa has told me
this, but I already knew it myself before he told
me. And now we are to see her dress, her new
ball dress that she has never worn.’</p>

<p>The new ball dress lay spread out upon the
bed. It was white, soft and filmy white, and
trimmed with delicate silver lace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Not for anything in the world would Anne
Marie have so much as laid a finger upon it. It
was far, far too beautiful for any little girl to
touch.</p>

<p>Beside the dress lay the softly gleaming silver
slippers that Maman was to wear. And there,
too, oh, how lovely! was the wreath of tiny
silver flowers that would rest like a crown on
Maman’s dark curling hair.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ breathed Anne Marie in delight. ‘Oh,
Grand’mère!’</p>

<p>Grand’mère nodded, smiling all the while, and
in silence she and Anne Marie stood looking at
the bed.</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Anne Marie suddenly, ‘I know
whom Maman will be like. She will be like my
little fairy dancer, only, of course, much more
beautiful. Come, Grand’mère! Come and see
my fairy dancer. She, too, is all silver and white.
See her dance, Grand’mère! See her whirl! I
can do that too.’</p>

<p>And, holding Polly’s hands, Anne Marie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
whirled and twirled like her little fairy dancer
until both she and Polly fell in a heap to the
floor.</p>

<p>‘It is now time for bed,’ said Grand’mère,
‘and there is much for you to do to-night before
you go to sleep.’</p>

<p>In less time than you might think, Anne
Marie was washed and brushed and in her nightgown,
almost ready for bed.</p>

<p>Almost ready for bed, but not quite. For it
was Christmas Eve, remember, and although
Anne Marie was not going to hang up her stocking,
she was going to leave her shoe beside the
hearth.</p>

<p>And would the little Noel fill a shoe as surely
as Kris Kringle would stuff a stocking with toys
and goodies of every kind?</p>

<p>Certainly he would.</p>

<p>He had done it over and over for Papa and
Maman when they were little children in far-away
France. He had done it for Grand’mère
in that long-ago time when she was a little girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
like Anne Marie. Indeed, without doubt, he
would do it that very night for those little
children in France and elsewhere who believed
in him and who left one of their shoes beside the
hearth for him to fill.</p>

<p>So Anne Marie made ready to place her shoe
beside the hearth.</p>

<p>‘Shall I take one of my best shoes, Grand’mère?’
asked Anne Marie, ‘my shiny shoes
with the gray tops? Or would you take one of
my everyday brown shoes, do you think?’</p>

<p>‘The best shoe, perhaps,’ answered Grand’mère,
‘though little Noel is not one to scorn a
shabby shoe.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will take my everyday shoe,’ decided
Anne Marie, after a moment’s thought. ‘It is
not kind on Christmas Eve to take the best shoe
because it is the prettiest. Sometimes the
shiny shoes pinch me, and the brown ones never
do. Then, too, the brown shoe is the larger,’
added Anne Marie.</p>

<p>Down beside the hearth went the brown shoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
to wait for little Noel, and Anne Marie made
ready to light her Christmas candle.</p>

<p>‘This is for the little Noel,’ Anne Marie told
Polly softly, as Grand’mère in the window
pinned the curtains safely back and raised the
shade. ‘He will come to earth to-night, and in
the dark and cold my candle in the window may
be the very light he needs to guide him on his
way.’</p>

<p>The candle lighted and Anne Marie tucked in
bed, Grand’mère put out all other lights and
crept away.</p>

<p>Beside the bed on a chair sat Polly Perkins,
holding the little fairy dancer in her lap.</p>

<p>Of course, Anne Marie meant not to go to
sleep. She meant to stay awake and at least
hear the little Noel moving about, even though
she were not able to have a peep at him. Perhaps,
too, Maman would come in to say good-night
before she went to the ball.</p>

<p>The candle burned steadily, sending out a
clear yellow light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>‘Dear little Christ Child, dear little Noel,’
thought Anne Marie drowsily. ‘Will he see my
candle, I wonder, to-night? Will he come down
the long, long way from heaven, the long, long
way—’</p>

<p>And while thinking these long, long thoughts,
Anne Marie fell asleep.</p>

<p>Just why Anne Marie woke in the middle of
the night she never knew. There was not a
sound, not even the ticking of the clock to be
heard.</p>

<p>The candle was still burning. Its soft yellow
light made a bright glow in one corner of the
dark room, and there, before Anne Marie, directly
in the light stood—the Christmas
Angel!</p>

<p>How could Anne Marie be mistaken?</p>

<p>The Angel was in white, as Angels always
are, and she glistened from head to foot as if
powdered with star-dust or light-o’-the-moon.
She stood quite still, with a sweet smile on her
face, but as Anne Marie watched, slowly and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
light as a feather the Angel moved toward her
bed.</p>

<p>Anne Marie held her breath. She was not in
the least afraid. Over her bed bent the Angel,
and Anne Marie felt a kiss, the gentlest, softest
kiss you may imagine, placed upon her forehead.</p>

<p>It was all so beautiful! so lovely! Anne Marie
wished that the Angel might stay with her forever.
Not for any reason would she stir and perhaps
startle the Angel away.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes for an instant only, but
when she opened them again the room was dark.
The Christmas Candle had burned out and the
Christmas Angel had vanished.</p>

<p>When Anne Marie next awoke, the room was
filled with daylight. It was a gray light, to be
sure, for already a few flakes were drifting down
from the cloudy sky and the day promised to be
a snowy one.</p>

<p>But at least morning had come, and it took
Anne Marie only a moment to dart to the hearth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and find her shoe well-filled, to carry it in to
Maman and Papa’s bedside, to wish them a
‘Joyeux Noel’ With many kisses, and then to
climb upon the bed to see what was in her shoe.</p>

<p>An orange, candy, a gay little purse filled
with golden pennies, a box of colored pencils, a
silver thimble, for Anne Marie dearly loved to
sew.</p>

<p>It was remarkable how many presents the
little Noel had managed to put into one small
shoe.</p>

<p>And down in the very toe, where Anne Marie
might never have thought of looking—only, of
course, she did—was a box, and in the box a
ring, a real gold ring, set with three stones of
a most lovely shade of blue.</p>

<p>‘Turquoise, they are called,’ said Papa Durant.</p>

<p>The ring fitted Anne Marie exactly. How had
the little Noel known the size of her finger so
well?</p>

<p>But Anne Marie spent little time in thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of that. She had something so tell—the Visit
of the Christmas Angel.</p>

<p>As she told her story, Papa Durant nodded
and nodded again.</p>

<p>‘True, true,’ murmured he when Anne Marie
had finished. ‘It was truly an Angel that you
saw last night.’</p>

<p>But Maman only laughed softly and said,
‘But was it not all a Christmas dream, Anne
Marie?’</p>

<p>Anne Marie shook her head doubtfully. For
a moment she did not know quite what to say
or think. Perhaps it was a dream. But no,
Anne Marie felt almost certain that a real shining
Angel had stood beside her bed last night.</p>

<p>‘Why not ask your Polly Perkins?’ suggested
Papa. ‘She sat beside your bed, did she not?
and so must have seen all that went on during
the night.’</p>

<p>This was quite true, and Anne Marie ran for
Polly Perkins.</p>

<p>Maman was delighted with Polly and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
cape. She listened with interest to Anne
Marie’s account of Grandmother King’s Party.</p>

<p>But she only laughed again and again when
Anne Marie said solemnly to her dolly,</p>

<p>‘Polly Perkins, did I see the Christmas Angel
last night?’</p>

<p>Of course Polly didn’t answer out loud, but,
as Anne Marie said, she looked as if she meant
to say ‘yes.’</p>

<p>So then Anne Marie made up her mind.</p>

<p>‘I did see the Christmas Angel,’ said Anne
Marie.</p>

<p>And smiling at Anne Marie and Maman,
Papa Durant nodded,</p>

<p>‘Yes, Anne Marie, I, too, think that you did.’</p>

<small>WHAT SANTA CLAUS BROUGHT TO
AILIE McNABB</small></h2>
</div>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Granny</span>,’ said Ailie, ‘do you think Santa
Claus will come here to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Aye,’ answered Granny, ‘he might.’</p>

<p>‘Will you see him?’ asked Ailie.</p>

<p>‘Not I,’ answered Granny, ‘not a peep.’</p>

<p>‘Will I see him if I stay awake?’ asked Ailie
after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p>‘Not if you are canny,’ was Granny’s reply.
‘Santa Claus leaves nothing for bairns who lie
awake on Christmas Eve.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Ailie, ‘oh, doesn’t he?—Shall I
hang up my stocking?’ was Ailie’s next question.</p>

<p>‘You might,’ was Granny’s reply.</p>

<p>So Ailie hung her stocking, a well-mended
stocking, too, from a convenient nail by the
mantel-shelf, and with her head on one side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
watched it for a moment as it dangled empty
there.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Granny who, well
wrapped in her old plaid shawl, sat rocking
to and fro.</p>

<p>‘I hope Santa Claus will bring you something,
too,’ said Ailie.</p>

<p>‘I have had my Christmas already,’ replied
Granny, ‘a good new friend round the corner
and a cure for my cough.’</p>

<p>‘But perhaps Santa Claus will bring you
something more,’ said Ailie hopefully, as she
climbed into bed with Polly in her arms.</p>

<p>‘Snuggle doun,’ said Ailie to Polly, ‘while I
tell you a secret. I told it to the other Polly and
now I will tell it to you. This is what I would
like rare fine, though I’m not thinking that
Santa Claus will bring it to me to-night. I
would like a mither, a pretty mither, who would
wear a dress made of silk like the one Patty’s
mither wore at the Party to-day. And I would
like a father who would put his hand in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
pocket and pull me out a penny just as if it were
nothing at all. And I would like four little
brothers and four little sisters to play with me.
I would wash them and dress them and take
them all out for a walk. But if I never had a one
of them, Polly, I would not cry, because I have
you, and so long as I have you I will never be
lonely again.’</p>

<p>Hand in hand lay Ailie and Polly on the bed.
But presently in her sleep Ailie turned over and
burrowed down under the bedclothes until you
couldn’t see so much as the tip of her nose nor
one of the sandy ringlets that clustered all over
the top of her round little head. So far under
the bed-covers went she that no doubt that
is why Ailie heard not a sound all the night
long.</p>

<p>But Polly, lying beside her on the bed, did not
close her pretty brown eyes the whole night
through. So Polly must have seen Santa Claus,
for certainly Ailie’s stocking was filled when she
woke in the morning, and who, may I ask,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
filled the stocking unless Santa Claus himself
had been there?</p>

<p>Polly, too, through the window, must have
watched the moon sail slowly past in the Christmas
sky. She must have seen the stars twinkle
and burn and then grow pale as little by little
the light grew stronger and at last morning
came. No doubt Polly saw the great gray snow-clouds
spread and spread until the whole sky
was covered over and the first frosty flakes
came softly fluttering down.</p>

<p>Last of all, Polly must have heard the clatter
of feet on the stairs, a clatter that came nearer
and nearer to Ailie’s little room at the very tiptop
of the tall, tall building until at last the
clatter stopped just outside Ailie’s own door.</p>

<p>Now Granny was already awake and dressed
when the noise came up the stair.</p>

<p>‘Who can it be so early in the day?’ said
Granny to herself.</p>

<p>But when she opened the door and saw who
it was standing there on the little landing, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
flung both arms about Aunt Elspeth’s neck—for
it was Aunt Elspeth herself whom Granny
saw standing there—and joyfully brought her
into the little room. And behind Aunt Elspeth
came Uncle Rob, carrying a big bag in one hand,
and with a white bundle carefully held in his
other arm.</p>

<p>Oh, how glad Granny was to see Aunt Elspeth
and Uncle Rob, come all the way from
Scotland over the sea, and, oh, how glad they
both were to see Granny, too!</p>

<p>Then Aunt Elspeth made Granny sit down
in the rocking-chair and very gently she took
the white bundle from Uncle Rob’s arms.</p>

<p>She laid it in Granny’s lap, she unpinned a
soft white blanket, and there looking up into
Granny’s face lay a little rosy baby with blue
eyes and a sandy curl or two that might have
belonged to Ailie McNabb herself.</p>

<p>‘This is Thomas,’ said Aunt Elspeth proudly,—‘my
Thomas. But we call him Tammus
for short.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>‘He is the image of our Ailie,’ said Granny,
hugging wee Tammus and rocking him to and
fro and never once taking her eyes off his round
rosy little face.</p>

<p>‘Ailie?’ cried Aunt Elspeth. ‘Where is Ailie?’</p>

<p>There she was, fast asleep, rolled into a ball
in the middle of the bed.</p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth took off all wee Tammus’s outside
wrappings, and then with a smile she
tucked him under the covers, right down beside
Ailie in the bed.</p>

<p>Now Tammus was wide awake and he didn’t
mean to lie still a moment longer. His fat little
legs waved to and fro, his short arms struck out
right and left, and with a mighty thump Tammus
turned himself over and began to crawl
up on his Cousin Ailie’s head.</p>

<p>So Ailie woke. And when she saw a real live
pink-and-white baby crawling and tumbling
about in the bed, at first Ailie didn’t know what
to think, and then in a moment she understood
just what had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>‘Santa Claus brought him,’ said Ailie.
‘Santa Claus brought him to me.’</p>

<p>Then Ailie saw Aunt Elspeth and Uncle Rob,
and she opened her eyes wider than ever before.</p>

<p>‘Is it a mither for me?’ asked Ailie in her surprise.
‘A mither and a father too?’</p>

<p>‘No, Ailie,’ said Granny with a shake of the
head, but smiling as Ailie had not seen her smile
in many a long day, ‘but it is almost as good.
It is Aunt Elspeth and Uncle Rob come from
Scotland to take care of you and me.’</p>

<p>When Aunt Elspeth picked up Ailie and
hugged her close, Ailie put both arms about
Aunt Elspeth’s neck and felt that this was the
very best present that Santa Claus had ever
brought to a little girl.</p>

<p>Then Ailie asked a question that first surprised
Aunt Elspeth and then that made her
laugh.</p>

<p>‘Have you a silk dress?’ asked Ailie in Aunt
Elspeth’s ear.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ whispered back Aunt Elspeth, ‘a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
bright blue silk. Will you like it, do you think?’</p>

<p>‘Aye,’ answered Ailie, patting Aunt Elspeth’s
back in her delight, ‘and when you put it on you
will be prettier than Patty’s mither, for your
cheeks are rosier than hers.</p>

<p>‘I did want four little brothers and four little
sisters,’ went on Ailie, after a bit, ‘but Tammus
will do just as well as all of them, I think.’</p>

<p>‘He will be much easier to take care of,’ agreed
Aunt Elspeth. ‘And then you know Uncle Rob
is going to buy a farm, and you and Granny are
coming to live with us there. We will have hens
and chickens and ducks, and a pig, and a cow,
and horses, too. You will have plenty of friends
to play with there. You will never miss the four
little brothers and four little sisters, I ween.’</p>

<p>‘Aye, Aunt Elspeth,’ said Ailie happily,
‘’twill be rare fine for Granny and Tammus and
me.’</p>

<p>Uncle Rob proved to be so kind and friendly
that Ailie, sitting upon his lap, went so far as to
confide to him ‘her secret,’ her secret wish for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
mother and a father and brothers and sisters,
too, and how she now thought that he and Aunt
Elspeth and Tammus would take their places
and answer just as well.</p>

<p>And when, later in the day, Uncle Rob did
actually put his hand in his pocket and pull out
a penny for Ailie, ‘just as if it were nothing at
all,’ you couldn’t have found a happier little
girl in New York City than Ailie McNabb.</p>

<p>‘It is a grand Christmas Day, Polly,’ said
Ailie as she and Polly Perkins settled down in
a corner for a quiet little talk. ‘Santa Claus
brought me everything. A stocking full of
goodies, oranges and nuts and candies, too.
And he brought me Aunt Elspeth and Tammus
and Uncle Rob.</p>

<p>‘But I will always love you most, Polly, never
fear, because I knew you first of all. Aye, I will
always love you rare fine, Polly Perkins,’ said
little Ailie McNabb.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE VERY BEST CHRISTMAS OF ALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> morning, early and dark and gray!</p>

<p>Patty woke, she sat up in bed, she listened.</p>

<p>Not a sound!</p>

<p>Father and Mother and Grandmother must
still be fast asleep.</p>

<p>Had Santa Claus come last night?</p>

<p>There was one sure way of telling. Was her
stocking filled?</p>

<p>So Patty slipped out of bed and stole into the
living-room.</p>

<p>There stood the Tree, fragrant and green,
looking taller and more beautiful than ever in
the dull morning light.</p>

<p>Under the Tree, propped comfortably against
the low branches, sat Polly Perkins King. Her
face wore a wise little smile as if she knew all
that had happened last night, but would never,
never tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>‘Merry Christmas, Polly,’ whispered Patty
as she crept into the room. ‘Oh, look at my
stocking, look!’</p>

<p>Yes, the stocking that last night had hung
from the mantelpiece, so thin and limp, had now
become delightfully plump and thick, with
strange little bumps and knobs all over it, and
with packages actually peeping over the edge of
the top, it was so full.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ said Patty again, her eyes fixed on the
stocking, ‘oh, Polly, look!’</p>

<p>Up on a chair climbed Patty and with nimble
fingers unfastened the stocking and lifted it
down.</p>

<p>Then into Mother’s room she ran to wake
Mother and Father and Grandmother, too,
across the hall, and to be the very first one to
wish them all a Merry Christmas Day.</p>

<p>You would never guess all the presents that
had been crowded into Patty’s stocking.</p>

<p>Of course there were apples and oranges and
candies and nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>There was a little watch to be worn on Patty’s
wrist.</p>

<p>‘Not a really truly watch,’ explained Patty,
‘but just as good as a really truly one.’</p>

<p>There was a pair of soft gray gloves all lined
with fur.</p>

<p>‘As soft as a kitten and as warm as a bear,’
declared Patty, trying them on at once.
‘Maybe Santa Claus wears this kind his very
own self.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe he does,’ answered Father. ‘Open
that long box, Patty. It says on the card,
“Merry Christmas from Thomas.” Perhaps
Santa Claus came in through the hall last
night, for Thomas must have asked him to put
this in your stocking for him.’</p>

<p>Thomas was the hall boy, you remember, and
a good friend to Patty, too.</p>

<p>So Patty untied Thomas’s box. It held a
large silk handkerchief, blue-and-red on one
side and red-and-blue on the other.</p>

<p>It was bright, it was gay, and Patty was
delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>‘But I shan’t use it for a handkerchief,’ said
she. ‘It is too good. I shall use it for a—for a
shawl,’ said Patty, putting it about her shoulders
and making herself look like a little Mother
Bunch.</p>

<p>‘You might wear it for a muffler under your
coat,’ suggested Father, ‘like my black-and-white
muffler, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I will,’ said Patty, ‘I will wear it this very
day.’</p>

<p>For Patty was going on a journey this Christmas
Day. She was going to Four Corners with
Father and Mother and Grandmother to eat her
Christmas dinner at the Farm with Aunt Mary
and Uncle Charles.</p>

<p>So Patty made haste to empty her stocking.</p>

<p>She found a string of beautiful pink coral
beads in the toe. There was a small paint-box,
and a book full of pictures all ready for Patty to
paint. There was a ball of gay red worsted and
two knitting-needles. Grandmother must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
known something about that, for she had long
ago promised to teach Patty to knit.</p>

<p>But the present in her stocking that Patty
liked best of all was a wee pair of brown mittens
so tiny that no little girl, not even a baby girl,
could possibly have squeezed her fingers into
them.</p>

<p>Then whom were the mittens for?</p>

<p>Patty knew in a minute.</p>

<p>‘They are for Polly!’ cried Patty. ‘They are
for Polly Perkins. She shall wear them to-day to
show Aunt Mary and Uncle Charles.’</p>

<p>Yes, Polly Perkins was going with Patty to
the Farm. Mother had said she might because
it was Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Soon they were ready for the journey. Polly
Perkins looked well, dressed in her new brown
cape and hood, trimmed with beaver fur, and
her brown mittens that were a perfect fit.
Patty, too, wore her new fur-lined gloves, and
her string of pink coral beads, while about her
neck as a muffler was Thomas’s gay silk handkerchief,
the blue-and-red side out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>But just before Patty left the house, she began
to run around, looking here and there and
asking every one,</p>

<p>‘Where are my mice? Where are my five
mice? Oh, Mother! Oh, Grandmother! Please
help me find my mice!’</p>

<p>What did Patty mean? Why should a little
girl want to find five mice? And just as she was
starting on a journey, too!</p>

<p>Well, wait and see.</p>

<p>The mice were found, tucked away in a paper
bag, and were placed in Father’s overcoat
pocket for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>And then they were off.</p>

<p>The snow was falling, a flake here and a flake
there, when they started. But as the train sped
farther and farther along into the country, the
ground grew white and the window-panes of the
train were dotted thick with flying snow. Soon
each little bush and tree was clothed in a warm
white cloak, while every fencepost and pole
wore a round white hood or a tall pointed cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
that gave to some of them the sauciest air in the
world.</p>

<p>It was a real snowstorm, and Patty couldn’t
help thinking that nothing could have been
planned that would have given her greater
pleasure.</p>

<p>She thought the country beautiful in its covering
of spotless white.</p>

<p>She was delighted when Uncle Charles met
them at the Four Corners Station with the old
two-seater and the farm team of horses, instead
of the automobile. As the horses pulled and
plunged through the snow, Patty and Polly
peeped over the edge of the carriage robe, their
eyes very bright and their noses very red, but
with their fingers as warm as toast in their new
Christmas gloves, and both of them enjoying
every moment of their ride.</p>

<p>The old red farmhouse looked pretty and
homelike in its heavy trimming of soft white
snow. And there in the doorway stood Aunt
Mary, so anxious to see her visitors that she
couldn’t wait indoors another moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Presents, and another beautiful Christmas
Tree, and every one laughing and talking and
wishing ‘Merry Christmas’ all at once. That is
what happened at first, with Patty in the midst
of it, hopping about, and sitting on people’s laps,
and then slipping away to walk around the
Christmas Tree again and again.</p>

<p>But presently Patty remembered something.</p>

<p>‘Where are the kitties, Aunt Mary?’ asked
Patty, ‘the four new little kitties you wrote
Mother to tell me about?’</p>

<p>‘Out in the barn,’ said Aunt Mary. ‘Would
you like to see them? Uncle Charles will take
you out there if you do.’</p>

<p>‘I have brought each of them a Christmas
present, and one for their mother, too,’ said
Patty with a happy face. ‘They are mice, little
mice made of catnip, and I would like to give
them to the kitties now.’</p>

<p>‘You might see whether your present for
Patty is dry yet,’ called Aunt Mary after Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Charles, as, well wrapped up, he and Patty and
the mice set out for the barn.</p>

<p>‘Another present for me? Do let me see
it, Uncle Charles,’ begged Patty, all excitement.</p>

<p>So up the narrow barn stairs to the loft went
Patty and Uncle Charles and the mice. And
there in one corner of the loft stood a cradle, an
old-fashioned wooden cradle, made by Uncle
Charles for Polly Perkins as soon as Grandmother’s
letter telling of the three Polly Perkinses
had reached the Farm. It was painted a
lovely shade of blue, and though the paint was
still a little moist, Uncle Charles believed it
would be quite dry by night so that the cradle
might be safely carried home.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Mary has made the pillows and sheets
and blankets for it,’ said Uncle Charles, setting
the cradle aswing. ‘This is the kind of a bed
your great-grandmother was put to sleep in,
Patty King.’</p>

<p>Then down the stairs went happy Patty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Uncle Charles to see the four new kitties and
their mother.</p>

<p>The big gray mother cat was sleepy and
plump, but she had the most interesting and
lively family of kittens that Patty had ever
seen. One was gray, one was black-and-white,
one was all white with pale blue eyes, and the
last and smallest and liveliest one of all was
orange-yellow and white, ‘a tortoise-shell kitten,’
Uncle Charles said it was called.</p>

<p>How the kittens did like their catnip mice!
Even their sleepy old mother tossed and boxed
her mouse about, and presently ran up and
down the length of the barn as lively as any
of her lively brood of kittens, who leaped and
tumbled and raced about to their hearts’ content
and to Patty’s great entertainment.</p>

<p>‘I think they are so excited because this is the
first Christmas present they have ever had,’
said Patty to Uncle Charles, as after a peep at
the horses and the cows they made their way
through the snow back to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Then out came the little pillows and mattress
and sheets and blankets for Polly Perkins’s
new cradle. And when they had been admired
and shown to every one, and to Polly Perkins,
too, it was dinner-time.</p>

<p>So it was not until after dinner and late in the
afternoon that Patty was able to sit down in
peace and quiet with Polly and talk over this
most delightful Christmas Day.</p>

<p>‘Of course, Polly,’ said Patty, ‘this is the
first Christmas you have ever had. You must

very best Christmas of all.’</p>
